## About me

I am YAN Yuhang Henry (闫禹杭), a final-year **Computer Science** undergraduate at **The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)** and a member of the Faculty of Engineering's ELITE Stream. During my second and third years, I had the opportunity to spend exchange semesters at Peking University (**PKU**) and École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (**EPFL**). My research and internship experiences have primarily focused on **multimodal AI application** and **AI safety**, and I am still trying to explore various fields to enrich my knowledge.

💥 <span style="color:#e89b00">Currently, I am applying to graduate programs in the United States for Fall 2025, hoping this new journey will better prepare me for my future academic and professional endeavors.</span>
